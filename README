This website allows head cooks in OSCA to add recipes to the database, search for recipes by name or ingredient; with or without dietary restrictions.
Users can also create a menu of the recipes they want to make. 
Future additions would include an auto-scale feature for a menu that would scale ingredients based on number of people to feed. 
This website was created by Adina Shanholtz at Oberlin College Fall 2014.
