This website will allow head cooks in OSCA to search for recipes by main or excess ingredient (for example the co-op just has a ton of Swiss chard no one used) with or without dietary restrictions. I would start by hard coding the OSCA cookbook into the database. Extra features would consist of allowing other people to add their own recipes to the database, a separate section for special meals (ingredients you'd have to special order), narrower search functions (such as find based on list of ingredients or narrow by co-op), and a meal planning feature that would auto-scale ingredients based on co-op size.
This website was created by Adina Shanholtz at Oberlin College Fall 2014.
